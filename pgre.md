I wanted to outline my prep for the pGRE here. I've compiled a list of texts I plan to work through over the next few weeks/months. I plan on writing the test in November 2017.

```
Topic                     Text 1              Text 2              Text 3
Electrodynamics           Griffiths           Jackson
Classical Mechanics       Kleppner            Serway/Giancoli     Landau
Quantum Mechanics         Griffiths           Desai
Thermodynamics            Cengel              Chang (*)
Special Relativity        Harris
Optics and Waves          King
```

I also used "Conquering the Physics GRE" by Kahn and Anderson and "Physics: A Student's Companion" by Lowry Kirkby as supplemental resources. Schaum's, "3000 Solved Problems in Physics" was also an invaluable resource. I will post my score here as soon as I have it.

(*) Chang is technically a chemistry text; I did find it useful for review however.
