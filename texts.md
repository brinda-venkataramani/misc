# Textbook reviews

I figured that as I'm reviewing some content for the GREs and qualifying exams, I would write some reviews for the texts I'm using. Note that everything below is just my opinion; you might get better use out of a different set of texts.

## Linear Algebra by Serge Lang

This is the first book where I've understood why certain systems are guaranteed to have non-trivial solutions. Lang's exposition of topics using dimensionality arguments is great. I guess my only complaint would be that some of the problems are lacking and the presentation is albeit dry. Nonetheless, he presents the content you'll likely need to know for the GRE and the typical qualifying exam. I recommend supplementing Lang with Hoffman's book.
