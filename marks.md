Grades received in final two years of my undergraduate degree at McMaster. There's no real ordering to the courses within each term.

I switched into math in Fall 2018.

Note that Math 4ET3, Math 4L03, Math 4GR3, Math 4LT3, and Math 4E03,  are equivalent to the following graduate level courses: Math 6ET3, Math 6L03, Math 6GR3, Math 6LT3, and Math 6E03. I have taken two reading courses in mathematics (4W03). More specifially, here are a list of the graduate courses I have taken in math:

```
Course Code         Course Title                               Grade (on 12.0 scale)

Math (4/6)ET3       Topics in Algebra                          12
Math (4/6)L03       Introduction to Logic                      11

[*] Combined cohort with Math 712 in Winter 2019 when I took the course. The topic was model theory of the p-adics. At the end of the term, I gave a talk on a paper by Lou van den Dries entitled "Elimination of quantifiers in algebraic structures". The now edited slides are available somewhere on my Github. 
[**] This was a reading course I took under the supervision of Dr. Valeriote. The topic was the theory of computation. essentially spent the term working through the book Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Sipser, and giving small talks on the content to my small group of peers. I gave a 25 minute talk at the end of course on potential non-complexity theory approaches to the P vs. NP problem.

Here are my GPA totals for my 4th/5th year (I update this as and when I receive my grades):

```

GPA in Mathematics: 11.0 (~ 3.9/4.0) [*]
Overall GPA: 10.76 (~ 3.8/4.0)

```

I was admitted into the graduate program at McMaster itself. I decided that I would spend the year writing all the standardized tests necessary to get into a top tier graduate school in the US for my PhD. I also decided to take the PhD qualifying exams at McMaster this year, since Master's students are eligible to attempt it with no penalty. Supposedly, it looks good on an application.

To that effect, here are my standardized test scores:

```
Test                Score

General GRE
Mathematics GRE
Physics GRE

```

Here is my score on the comprehensive exam:

```
Test                Score

Comprehensive Exam

```

Of course, academic excellence is also a prerequisite to be considered for admission into a top tier graduate school. So here are my marks acheived in my Master's degree (I haven't decided on a third course for the Winter term; I'm hoping Lie Groups is offered. Otherwise, I'll probably take Algebra I or something; maybe Analysis II. I plan on sitting in on Analysis I in the Fall term.):
