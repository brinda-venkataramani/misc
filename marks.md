Might as well document my marks in all relevant courses over the course of my undergraduate career at the University of Toronto. (Mainly third and fourth year courses as well as the occassional second year math/stats courses.) It's interesting to note that at this point in time I had not taken a freshman course in physics.

I find the distribution of my marks to be quite interesting as well.
