Might as well document my marks in all relevant courses over the course of my undergraduate career at the University of Toronto/McMaster University. (Mainly third and fourth year courses as well as the occassional second year math/stats courses.) It's interesting to note that at this point in time I had not taken a freshman course in physics.

I find the distribution of my marks to be quite interesting as well.
