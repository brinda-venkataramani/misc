Grades received in final two years of my undergraduate degree at McMaster. There's no real ordering to the courses within each term.

I switched into math in Fall 2018.

Note that Math 4ET3, Math 4L03, Math 4GR3, Math 4LT3, and Math 4E03,  are equivalent to the following graduate level courses: Math 6ET3, Math 6L03, Math 6GR3, Math 6LT3, and Math 6E03. I have taken two reading courses in mathematics (4W03). More specifially, here are a list of the graduate courses I have taken in math:

```
Course Code         Course Title                               Grade (on 12.0 scale)

Math (4/6)ET3       Topics in Algebra                          12
Math (4/6)L03       Introduction to Logic                      11
Math (4/6)GR3       Groups and Rings                           11
Math (4/6)LT3       Topics in Logic                                                  [*]
Math (4/6)E03       Galois Theory 
Math 4W03           Reading in Mathematics                                           [**]

[*] Combined cohort with Math 712 in Winter 2019 when I took the course. The topic was model theory of the p-adics. At the end of the term, I gave a talk on a paper by Lou van den Dries entitled "Elimination of quantifiers in algebraic structures". The now edited slides are available somewhere on my Github. 
[**] This was a reading course I took under the supervision of Dr. Valeriote. The topic was the theory of computation. essentially spent the term working through the book Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Sipser, and giving small talks on the content to my small group of peers.

Here are my GPA totals for my 4th/5th year (I update this as and when I receive my grades):

```

GPA in Mathematics: 11.25 (~ 3.9/4.0) [*]
Overall GPA: 10.83 (~ 3.85/4.0)

My overall GPA in math over all 5 years of my undergraduate studies at McMaster is 10.5 (~ 3.8/4.0).
