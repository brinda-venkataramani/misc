I switched into math in Fall 2018.

Note that Math 4ET3, Math 4L03, Math 4GR3, Math 4LT3, and Math 4E03,  are equivalent to the following graduate level courses: Math 6ET3, Math 6L03, Math 6GR3, Math 6LT3, and Math 6E03. Math 4LT3/6LT3 was a combined cohort with Math 712 in Winter 2019 when I took it. More specifially, here are a list of the graduate courses I have taken in math:

```
